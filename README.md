## 👋 Hi, Aashray Bissa here....

💻 I’m a Computer Science student who genuinely enjoys **solving problems and building things from scratch**.  
I love **Data Structures & Algorithms** because breaking down problems, optimizing solutions, and understanding *why* something works excites me the most.

🎮 Alongside DSA and development, my **main long-term goal** is to become a **game programmer**. I’m deeply interested in how games and game engines work under the hood — from performance and memory to systems and low-level logic — and I want to build things myself like game engines.

🛠️ I also work on **development projects**, focusing on both frontend and backend, to strengthen my overall software engineering fundamentals.

🎸 Apart from coding, I love playing **rock & metal guitar** with a touch of **80s clean sound** — my creative escape that keeps me focused and disciplined.

📌 This repository represents my **Overall Developer Journey** — practice, projects, experiments — as I keep leveling up as a developer.
